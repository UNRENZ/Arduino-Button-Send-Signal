The Arduino Button Send Signal project reads the state of a button connected to pin 12. When the button is pressed, it sends "1" to the Serial Monitor, and when not pressed, it sends "0". This allows the Arduino to detect button presses and communicate the state through serial data, making it useful for triggering events or controlling devices based on button input
